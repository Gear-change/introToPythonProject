the difficulties I had encountered making this project include:
1. figuring out tkinter, which is what the breezy plugin was based on, as it is included with python 3 by default, there were many issues regarding x not showing up. this took time.
2. figuring out fpdf2, which is a python library for building pdf's, it is a branch of fpdf. fpdf and by extension fpdf2 was finiky to work with, but we got it working.
3. ensuring I was not accedentally excluding my partner, as I started to have fun while coding, and became a minor workaholic.
4. NULL VARIABLE POINTERS, they are not fun, especially when reading a list of strings.
5. Saving and Loading of inputs, still partially not done due to them not clearing when loading, but that is more a minor issue, not a major, and considering all the work needed, not a major issue.
6. am introvert. breaking my shell hard.
7. deciding to break up the single large file into many smaller ones created bugs that I was not expecting, but they were the easily fixed kind, for the most part.
8. the names of said files starting with numbers caused issues when the IMPORT function was called on them, python must interpret them as a different instruction.
9. another class project going to defcon 1 due to that groups presention being pushed forward was not benifitial to the coding of this project.
10. I have autism. communication hard.
